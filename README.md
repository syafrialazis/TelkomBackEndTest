This repository here is only present for an interview with Telkom Indonesia. Please contact me should you have any questions.

Note that i am using golang when building the application and please find the 3 files requested for the interview in this repo.

logCopy.go  --> The golang script file of the application
logCopy     --> Unix executable of the application
logCopy.exe --> Windows executable of the application

Please note that the windows version should always supply the -o parameter, as the built in function that is used for directory management is using unix based directory as opposed to a windows one.
